# Input Focus Fix

## Problem
The authentication form inputs were losing focus after typing one character because the `InputField` component was being recreated on every render.

## Root Cause
The `InputField` component was defined inside the `AuthForm` component, which caused React to see it as a new component on each render, leading to focus loss.

## Solution
1. **Moved `InputField` outside** the `AuthForm` component
2. **Memoized the component** using `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
3. **Added `displayName`** for better debugging

## Files Fixed
- `components/molecules/AuthForm/AuthForm.tsx` - Main authentication form
- `app/reset-password/page.tsx` - Password reset form

## Technical Details
```typescript
// Before (causing focus loss)
const AuthForm = () => {
  const InputField = ({ ... }) => ( ... ) // Recreated on each render
  return <InputField ... />
}

// After (fixed)
const InputField = memo(({ ... }) => ( ... )) // Memoized, stable reference
const AuthForm = () => {
  return <InputField ... />
}
```

## Testing
- ✅ Input fields maintain focus while typing
- ✅ Form validation still works correctly
- ✅ Password visibility toggle still works
- ✅ Error states display properly
- ✅ All authentication flows work as expected

## Benefits
- **Better UX** - Users can type continuously without interruption
- **Performance** - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- **Stability** - Consistent component behavior
- **Maintainability** - Cleaner component structure
